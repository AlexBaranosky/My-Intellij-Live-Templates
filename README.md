These are the Intellij Live Templates I like to use to make developing in Java and Scala more fluid.  Why spend your time/effort typing, when you could use it thinking about the problem at hand?

I've kept all my live templates to 2 unique chars, to be clear 'tst' has two unique chars =)

How to Use Them
===============

1. Open user.xml, copy out all of the <template> nodes, out of the <templateSet>

2. Go to ~/.IdeaC10/config/templates/user.xml, and append my <template> nodes to your <templateSet>  (on Windows, the .Ideaxyz folder isprobably in your home directory, but I haven't checked.  Also, it will have a slightly different name depending on version number, or whether you are using Community edition or Ultimate edition.

3. To ~/.IdeaC10/config/templates/user.xml append my <template> nodea to your <templateSet> node, and save.

4. Enjoy the goodness.
